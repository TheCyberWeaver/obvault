| Positive (正)                      | Positive (正)                      | Positive (正)                      | **Analysis**: All three cash flows being positive suggests that the company is generating cash, investing, and raising funds successfully. This situation generally indicates good financial health, but if financing activity is too high, it may signal an increased debt burden or dependency on external funding, which needs monitoring. **Conclusion**: Positive financial status, but assess financing reliance.                                                |
| Positive (正)                      | Negative (负)                      | Positive (正)                      | **Analysis**: Positive operating cash flow with investment outflows suggests the company is in a growth phase, reinvesting in its business. The positive financing cash flow indicates the company is likely borrowing or raising capital to support expansion. **Conclusion**: Reflects a company in expansion, leveraging external financing to support investments, typically viewed positively for growth-oriented companies.                                      |
| Positive (正)                      | Positive (正)                      | Negative (负)                      | **Analysis**: Positive operating and investing cash flows combined with negative financing cash flow suggests that the company is generating enough cash to fund its investments and is reducing debt or repaying loans. **Conclusion**: This is a favorable scenario, as it indicates self-sufficiency and strong financial health, with potential for sustainable growth without reliance on external financing.                                                     |
| Positive (正)                      | Negative (负)                      | Negative (负)                      | **Analysis**: Positive operating cash flow with negative investing and financing cash flows generally indicates a mature company that funds its investments from its own operations and does not rely on new financing. **Conclusion**: Strong financial stability, showing that the company is able to sustain growth internally and may not require external capital.                                                                                                |
| Negative (负)                      | Positive (正)                      | Positive (正)                      | **Analysis**: Negative operating cash flow with positive investing and financing cash flows could mean that the company is selling assets and raising funds to cover operational shortfalls. This situation can be a red flag, indicating potential issues with the company's core operations and sustainability. **Conclusion**: Risky; indicates dependency on asset sales and financing, which is unsustainable in the long term without improvement in operations. |
| Positive (正)                      | Positive (正)                      | Negative (负)                      | **Analysis**: Positive cash flow from operations and investments with negative financing cash flow indicates the company is self-sufficient, investing in growth, and reducing its debt obligations. **Conclusion**: This combination is ideal and reflects a financially strong, stable company with good cash generation, healthy reinvestment, and decreasing reliance on debt.                                                                                     |
| Negative (负)                      | Positive (正)                      | Positive (正)                      | **Analysis**: Negative operating cash flow with positive investing and financing cash flows could indicate that the company is attempting to turn around its performance by selling assets and taking on debt. However, persistent negative operating cash flow may highlight fundamental issues. **Conclusion**: Warning sign; high-risk situation where the company may face challenges if operational cash flow does not improve.                                   |
| Negative (负)                      | Negative (负)                      | Negative (负)                      | **Analysis**: Negative cash flows in all three categories are a critical warning sign. It implies that the company is struggling operationally, isn’t investing in future growth, and may not have access to financing. This could lead to severe liquidity issues or potential bankruptcy if the situation persists. **Conclusion**: High financial distress, potentially unsustainable without significant restructuring or capital injection.                       |
