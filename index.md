# Welcome to my second brain

Welcome to the public incarnation of my Obsidian-powered vault—think of this as the digital extension of my memory. Here, ideas, research, and sparks of inspiration are captured, organized, and interconnected.

## What Is This?

This is my **Second Brain**:  
- A centralized place for notes and references  
- A networked repository where related concepts link and evolve 

## Why Does It Exist?

- **Capture** fleeting thoughts before they vanish  
- **Connect** disparate topics into coherent narratives  
- **Share** my learning process and invite feedback

## Table of Content

Math
- [[A First Course in Abstract Algebra]]
Finance
- [[Definition of Finance]]
Programming
- [[Leetcode Tasks]]
## Ongoing Updates

I’ll be continuously adding new topics and refining structures. Bookmark this page (or better yet, **star the repo**) and check back often—there’s always something new brewing!
