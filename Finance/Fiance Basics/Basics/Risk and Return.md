**Default risk** on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For example, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on required semiannual interest payments on a bond.
 
**Inflation risk** occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an investment due to rising prices or inflation.
 
**Diversifiable risk**, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or smallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these situations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.
 
**Non-diversifiable risk**, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated unnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta. Subsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.

- β=1: The asset moves in line with the market.
- β\>1: The asset is more volatile than the market (higher risk).
- β\<1: The asset is less volatile than the market (lower risk).
- β=0: The asset has no correlation with market movements.
 
**Political risk** is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers. This is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash flows. Political risk could come about due to zoning changes, product liability decisions, taxation, or even nationalization of a firm or industry.

**Market Risk:** risk of the whole stock market - Apple will do something in reaction to the aggregate stock market.
 
**Idiosyncratic Risk:** Apple only Risk - Steve Jobs death
