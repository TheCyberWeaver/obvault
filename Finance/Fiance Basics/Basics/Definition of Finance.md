## Business Finance:

1. **Working Capital Management (WCM)**:
    
    - This is about managing the company’s short-term finances — the money it needs to run daily operations.
    - It includes managing things like cash, short-term loans, and payments due soon.
    - The finance team sets policies on things like giving credit to customers, setting payment terms, and deciding when to use short-term loans from creditors.
    - Essentially, this area makes sure the company has enough money to cover everyday expenses without overspending.
2. **Capital Budgeting**:
    
    - This is about deciding on **big, long-term investments** like buying equipment, expanding facilities, or launching new projects.
    - Managers forecast (predict) the costs and benefits of these projects, including how much money they might make and any risks involved.
    - By carefully picking projects that promise good returns, managers aim to increase the company’s value in the long run.
    - This area is crucial because good investment decisions can significantly boost the company’s growth and value.
3. **Capital Structure**:
    
    - This is the mix of **long-term debt and equity (ownership shares)** that finances the company.
    - Managers decide how much the company should borrow versus how much should come from shareholders.
    - The goal is to balance borrowing and ownership so that the company can grow and generate more profits for shareholders without taking on too much risk.
