# Comparison with Cash-Basis Accounting

| Aspect                       | Accrual-Basis Accounting                                  | Cash-Basis Accounting                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **When Revenue is Recorded** | When it is earned, regardless of cash receipt             | Only when cash is received                  |
| **When Expense is Recorded** | When it is incurred, regardless of cash payment           | Only when cash is paid                      |
| **Accuracy**                 | Provides a more accurate picture of financial performance | May not accurately represent profitability  |
| **Complexity**               | More complex due to timing requirements for recognition   | Simpler, as it follows actual cash movement |
# Example: Prepaid Rent for Office Space

Imagine a company pays **$12,000 upfront** in January for a one-year lease on office space. This payment covers **12 months of rent** from January through December.

Using the **expense recognition (matching) principle**, the company should not record the entire $12,000 as an expense in January, even though that’s when the payment was made. Instead, the cost should be **spread over the 12 months** to match each month’s usage of the space with the cost of that month.  


# Importance in Financial Reporting

Because of accrual accounting:

- **Financial statements** better reflect the timing of actual business transactions.
    
- Investors, creditors, and other stakeholders get a **clearer view of profitability** and performance.
    
- It enables businesses to comply with **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)** or **International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)**, which require accrual accounting for accurate financial reporting.
