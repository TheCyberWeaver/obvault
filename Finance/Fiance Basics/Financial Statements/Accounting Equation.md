>  The basic accounting equation is:
> $$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}$$

### 1. **Assets**: What the Company Owns

- **Current Assets** (things the company expects to use or convert to cash soon, usually within a year):
    
    - **Cash**: $50,000 (money in the bank, ready to use).
        
    - **Accounts Receivable**: $30,000 (money customers owe to the company for products or services already provided).
        
    - **Inventory**: $20,000 (products or materials the company plans to sell).
        
- **Noncurrent Assets** (long-term items the company will use for many years):
    
    - **Equipment**: $80,000 (machines or tools the company uses to make products).
        
    - **Accumulated Depreciation on Equipment**: -$10,000 (value lost on equipment over time due to wear and tear).
        
    - **Building**: $120,000 (office or factory where the company operates).
        
    - **Land**: $70,000 (property owned by the company).
        

**In simple terms**: Assets are everything valuable that the company owns or can turn into money.

### 2. **Liabilities**: What the Company Owes

- **Current Liabilities** (debts the company has to pay off within a year):
    
    - **Accounts Payable**: $25,000 (money the company owes to suppliers or vendors).
        
    - **Short-term Loan**: $15,000 (a loan that needs to be repaid soon).
        
- **Noncurrent Liabilities** (debts the company will pay off over a longer time, more than a year):
    
    - **Long-term Loan**: $50,000 (a larger loan the company has more time to repay).
        
    - **Bond Payable**: $60,000 (a long-term debt the company owes to investors who bought its bonds).
        

**In simple terms**: Liabilities are the company’s debts or anything it owes to others.

---

### 3. **Owner’s Equity**: What Belongs to the Owners

- **Increases in Equity** (things that make the owners’ value in the company grow):
    
    - **Investments by Owners**: $30,000 (extra money the owners put into the company).
        
    - **Revenue**: $120,000 (income from selling products or services).
        
    - **Gains from Sale of Equipment**: $5,000 (profit from selling old equipment).
        
    - **Comprehensive Income**: $10,000 (any other income, like interest or investments).
        
- **Decreases in Equity** (things that reduce the owners’ value in the company):
    
    - **Distribution to Owners (Dividends)**: -$10,000 (money the company pays out to owners).
        
    - **Expenses**: -$70,000 (costs of running the business, like salaries, rent, and utilities).
        
    - **Losses on Disposal of Assets**: -$3,000 (money lost on selling something for less than its value).
        

**In simple terms**: Owner’s equity is the owners’ share of the company after paying off all debts. It grows with profits and investments and decreases with losses and expenses.

# 举例说明“来源和权益”

假设一家公司拥有以下财务状况：

- **资产**：$100,000
    
- **负债**：$60,000
    
- **所有者权益**：$40,000
    

从“来源和权益”的角度来看：

- **$100,000的资产**来源于**两个主要途径**：
    
    - **从债权人借来的$60,000**（负债），债权人对这些资产拥有权益。
        
    - **所有者的出资或公司留存收益的$40,000**（所有者权益），代表了所有者对公司资产的权益。
        

这种角度强调了**每一项资产背后都有相应的权益**：

- **债权人的权益**（负债）具有优先权，公司有法律义务优先偿还。
    
- **所有者的权益**（所有者权益）是在偿还所有负债后，所有者可以享有的剩余资产部分。

    - **Expenses**: -$70,000 (-)
        
    - **Losses on Disposal of Assets**: -$3,000 (-)
        

---

### How These Fit the Table:

|Category|Example Items|
|---|---|
|**Assets - Current**|Cash (+), Accounts Receivable (+), Inventory (+)|
|**Assets - Noncurrent**|Equipment (+), Accumulated Depreciation (-), Building (+), Land (+)|
|**Liabilities - Current**|Accounts Payable (-), Short-term Loan (-)|
|**Liabilities - Noncurrent**|Long-term Loan (+), Bond Payable (+)|
|**Owner's Equity - Decreases**|Distribution to Owners (-), Expenses (-), Losses (-)|
|**Owner's Equity - Increases**|Investments by Owners (+), Revenues (+), Gains (+), Comprehensive Income (+)|

### Explanation

- **Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities**: These are categorized based on whether they are expected to be converted to cash or settled within one year (current) or beyond one year (noncurrent).
    
- **Owner’s Equity**: Increases in equity come from owner investments, revenue, and gains. Decreases come from distributions, expenses, and losses.
    

This example aligns with the categories and signs (+ or -) in the table you provided, giving a clear picture of how these entries impact the accounting equation.
