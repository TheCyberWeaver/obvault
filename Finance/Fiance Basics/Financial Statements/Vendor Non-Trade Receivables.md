**Vendor Non-Trade Receivables** (供应商非贸易应收款) are amounts owed to a company by vendors or suppliers that are **not related to the regular sale of goods or services**. These receivables arise from transactions outside of the company’s core operations, which is why they are termed "non-trade."

### Breaking Down the Term

1. **Vendor** (供应商): Refers to suppliers or providers from whom the company purchases goods or services.
    
2. **Non-Trade Receivables** (非贸易应收款): Receivables that arise from transactions unrelated to the company’s primary business activities, such as sales of goods or services to customers.

### Examples of Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

- **Vendor Rebates or Incentives**: A company might have an agreement with a supplier to receive a rebate or incentive payment if it reaches a certain purchase volume. Until the rebate is paid, the company records it as a non-trade receivable.
    
- **Refunds Due**: If a company returns goods to a supplier or is overcharged, it may be entitled to a refund. The amount owed by the supplier would be recorded as a non-trade receivable.
    
- **Advance Payments**: If a company makes an advance payment to a vendor for a product or service that’s later delayed or cancelled, the vendor might owe the company a refund, recorded as a non-trade receivable.
