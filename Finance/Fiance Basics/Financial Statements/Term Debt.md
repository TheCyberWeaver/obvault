**Term Debt** (期限债务) is a type of loan or debt obligation that must be repaid over a specific period, known as the "term." This period is generally longer than one year, making it a **noncurrent liability** (长期负债) on the company’s [[Balance Sheet|balance sheet]].

### Key Characteristics of Term Debt:

1. **Fixed Repayment Schedule** (固定还款时间表):
    
    - Term debt is structured with regular repayments of principal and interest over the agreed term, which could range from a few years to decades.
        
    - Payments are scheduled at set intervals, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually, until the debt is fully repaid.
        
2. **Interest-Bearing** (有息债务):
    
    - Term debt includes interest payments, with the interest rate defined in the loan agreement.
        
    - Interest can be fixed or variable, depending on the loan terms, affecting the overall cost of the debt.
        
3. **Collateral Requirements** (抵押要求):
    
    - Many term debts, especially long-term ones, are secured by assets, meaning the borrower pledges collateral (e.g., property or equipment) that the lender can seize if payments are not made.
        
4. **Use of Funds**:
    
    - Companies often use term debt to finance substantial, long-term projects like buying machinery, expanding facilities, or making strategic investments.
        
    - It’s a popular financing choice for large capital expenditures that companies expect to pay off over time as they generate revenue.
        

### Types of Term Debt:

- **Short-Term Debt**: Debt with a term of less than one year (often shown as a current liability on the balance sheet).
    
- **Long-Term Debt**: Debt with a term longer than one year, typically reflected as a noncurrent liability.
    

### Example:

If a company borrows $1 million with a 5-year term and a fixed interest rate, it will make regular payments (including both interest and principal) over those 5 years. At the end of the term, the debt will be fully repaid.

### Term Debt vs. Notes Payable:

- **Term Debt** is a broader category, including any debt with a specified repayment term, while **Notes Payable** are often formalized loans that could be short or long-term.
    
- Term debt specifically emphasizes the fixed repayment period, whereas notes payable focus more on the promissory nature of the obligation.
    

In summary, **Term Debt** is a structured form of borrowing with a defined repayment schedule, typically used to finance long-term investments. It helps companies manage large expenditures by spreading costs over time, aligned with revenue generation from those investments.
