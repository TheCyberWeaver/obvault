**Retained Earnings** (留存收益) represent the accumulated profits that a company has decided to keep or reinvest in the business rather than distributing to shareholders as dividends. Think of it as the company’s “savings account” that grows over time from profits left in the business.

### Analogy: Retained Earnings as a Company’s Piggy Bank

Imagine a company as a person who gets a paycheck (net income) each month. After paying bills and spending on essentials (expenses), they have some money left over. This leftover money can be:

- **Spent** (like paying a dividend),
    
- **Saved in a piggy bank** (retained earnings), or
    
- **Invested** for future benefits (reinvesting in the business).
    

Each month, if this person doesn’t spend all their leftover money, they add it to their piggy bank. Over time, the piggy bank grows, helping them save for larger goals like buying a house, starting a business, or covering unexpected expenses.

In a similar way:

- **Retained Earnings** accumulate in the company’s "piggy bank" as it holds on to profits rather than distributing them.
    
- Over time, these retained earnings are reinvested in the company to help it grow, pay off debt, or fund new projects.
    

### Key Points

1. **Builds Over Time**: Like a piggy bank, retained earnings increase as profits accumulate over years.
    
2. **Used for Growth**: Retained earnings can be used to fund growth, pay off debt, or handle unexpected expenses.
    
3. **Reflects Past Success**: A healthy retained earnings balance indicates the company has consistently generated profits.
# Equation

The equation for **Retained Earnings** (留存收益) can be expressed as:

$$\text{Retained Earnings} = \text{All Earnings Since Inception} - \text{Total Dividends Paid}$$

Or, to incorporate changes over a specific period (such as a fiscal year):

$$\text{Ending Retained Earnings} = \text{Beginning Retained Earnings} + \text{Net Income} - \text{Dividends Paid}$$

### In Chinese:

$$留存收益=自成立以来的所有收益−已支付的股利总额$$

或者表示为某一特定期间的变化：

$$期末留存收益=期初留存收益+净收入−支付的股利$$
This equation shows that **retained earnings grow with net income** (profits) and **decrease with dividend payments**.
