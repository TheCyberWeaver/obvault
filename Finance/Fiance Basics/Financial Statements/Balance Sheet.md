# Limitations
 
- assets on the balance sheet, under generally accepted accounting principles ([[GAAP]]), are recorded at historical cost.
	- If the asset has appreciated over time, the higher market value of the assets would not be seen on the balance sheet.
- Estimates are another limitation of the balance sheet. Items on the balance sheet such as allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for bad debt are based on estimates.
- balance sheet reflects balances at only one given point in time.
	- For example, if a firm were concerned with certain ratios or investor/lender expectations of its cash balance, it could choose to not pay several vendor payments in the last week of December. Thus, on December 31, the firm reflects a high cash balance on its balance sheet. However, by the end of the first week of January, it has caught up on late vendor payments and again shows a low cash balance.
- Internally generated assets and the firm’s human capital are not included

# Expense Versus Payable

The expense incurred caused the payable, but it is distinctly separate from the payable.

### Example to Illustrate the Difference

Suppose a company receives a $1,000 invoice for office supplies in January, payable in 30 days.

1. **Expense Recording** (January):
    
    - The company incurs a $1,000 expense for office supplies in January when they’re used, even though it hasn’t paid for them yet.
        
    - **[[Income Statement]] Impact**: Record $1,000 as an expense, reducing net income.
        
2. **Payable Recording** (January):
    
    - Since the invoice is due in 30 days, the company records a $1,000 **Accounts Payable** on the balance sheet in January.
        
    - **Balance Sheet Impact**: Increase Accounts Payable by $1,000, showing the outstanding obligation.
        
3. **Payable Settlement (February)**:
    
    - When the company pays $1,000 in February, it reduces both **Cash** and **Accounts Payable** by $1,000.
        
    - **Balance Sheet Impact**: Decrease Cash by $1,000 and reduce Accounts Payable by $1,000.
        

In this example:

- **Expense** ($1,000) was recognized in January when the office supplies were used.
    
- **Payable** ($1,000) was recorded as a liability, remaining until the actual cash payment was made in February.
