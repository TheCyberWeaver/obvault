stock market indices in the United States. Both track the performance of a selection of large companies, but they differ in composition, calculation methods, and the insights they offer about the market.
# How the S&P Is Weighted
Stocks in the S&P 500 are weighted based on market value rather than their
stock prices. In this way, the S&P 500 attempts to ensure that a 10% change in a
$20 stock will affect the index in the same way as a 10% change in a $50 stock
will. 

# How the Dow Is Weighted
The DJIA is price-weighted. Rather than using a simple arithmetic average and
dividing by the number of stocks in the average, the Dow Divisor is used. This
divisor smooths out the effects of stock splits and dividends. The DJIA,
therefore, is affected only by changes in the stock prices, so companies with
a higher share price or a more extreme price movement have a greater effect on
the Dow.
