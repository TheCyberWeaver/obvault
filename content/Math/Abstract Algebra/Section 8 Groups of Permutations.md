> [!PDF|note] [[A First Course in Abstract Algebra.pdf#page=82&selection=222,0,239,44&color=note|p.77]]
> > Let A be a nonempty set, and let $S_A$ be the collection of all permutations of A. Then $S_A$ is a group under permutation multiplication.

## 8.7 Example

The nth dihedral group is defined as $D_n$ or the symmetries of a regular n-gon.
$S_3 \simeq D_3$

Or Every group is isomorphic a subgroup of a symmetric group $S_n$ 

THIS IS CRAZY
