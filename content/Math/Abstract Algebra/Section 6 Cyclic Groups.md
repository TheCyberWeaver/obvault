## 6.14 Theorem

> [!NOTE]
> Let G be a cyclic group with n elements and generated by a. Let $b \in G$ and let $b =a^s$. Then b generates a cyclic subgroup H of G containing n/d elements, where d is the greatest common divisor of n and s. 
> Also, $\langle a^s \rangle = \langle a^t \rangle$ if and only if gcd(s, n) = gcd(t, n)
