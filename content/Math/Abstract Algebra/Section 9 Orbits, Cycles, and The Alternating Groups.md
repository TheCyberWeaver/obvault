- Depends on a whole group G: OrbG(x) collects every image of x under every element of the group.
- It is a subset of the underlying set X on which G acts.

- Describes a **single** permutation $\sigma$: it shows how $\sigma$ sends each element “in a loop” among a small subset of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$.
- It is part of the **notation** or decomposition of $\sigma$ inside $S_n$​.

Think about a [[Determinant|determinant]]. Exchange any two rows of a square matrix changes the sign of the determinant.

A Permutation that can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions is called a **even permutation**.
Similar to a **odd permutation**.
